## Step 2: Create Your First Project

Once logged in, you'll need to create a project:

1. Navigate to the Projects page (this should be the default landing page)
2. Click the "New Project" button
3. Fill in the project details:
   - Project Name (e.g., "Example project")
   - Environment (Development, Staging, or Production)
   - Datacenter location
   - Encryption Strategy (AES-256, RSA-2048, or RSA-4096)
   - Optional: Enable additional functions as needed
4. Click "Create" to finalize your project

## Step 3: Create an API Key

To interact with the Qanapi API, you'll need an API key:

1. From your project page, navigate to the "API Keys" tab
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Note the warning that the key will only be displayed once
4. Copy and securely store your new API key

<Warning>
Your API key will only be displayed once. Make sure to store it securely as it cannot be retrieved later.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Create Data Classifications

Set up data classifications to categorize your sensitive data:

1. Go to the "Classifications" tab in your project
2. Click "Create Classification"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Health", "Commercial", "CUI")
4. Optionally add a description and customize colors
5. Click "Create"

## Step 5: Use the Smart Data Proxy

The Smart Data Proxy allows you to encrypt and protect data in HTTP requests:

```bash
curl --location 'https://your-tenant.qanapi.cloud/proxy/your-project-id' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Authorization: your_api_key' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Mode: encrypt' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Fields: title,body' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Classification: cui' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Title text to encrypt",
    "body": "Bunch of Body text to encrypt"
}'
```
