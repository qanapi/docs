# Creating a New Project

Projects are the foundation of your work with Qanapi. Each project can have its own encryption strategy, API keys, data classifications, and configuration settings.

## Navigating to the Projects Page

1. Log in to your Qanapi dashboard
2. In the left-hand sidebar, click on **Projects** to view and manage your projects
3. If you've just created your account, the Projects page will be empty

## Creating Your First Project

To create a new project:

1. Click on the **New Project** button located in the center of the Projects page
2. A popout form will appear where you can configure the details of your new project

## Project Configuration Options

When creating a new project, you'll need to specify several important settings:

### Basic Settings

- **Project Name**: Enter a unique name for your project (e.g., "Example project")
- **Environment**: Select the appropriate environment from the dropdown
  - **Development** - For testing and development work
  - **Staging** - For pre-production testing
  - **Production** - For live, production applications
  
<Warning>
Environments cannot be modified after creation, so choose carefully based on your intended use.
</Warning>

### Infrastructure Settings

- **Datacenter**: Choose the datacenter where your project data will be stored
  - Example: "GCP us-central1 (Council Bluffs, Iowa)"
  
- **Qanapi Engine Configuration**:
  - **Cloud (Fully Managed)**: The default option where Qanapi manages the infrastructure
  - **Custom**: If selected, you can enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address where you want the Qanapi engine to be configured

### Security Settings

- **Encryption Strategy**:
  - **AES-256**: FIPS 140-2 and quantum-resistant, Symmetric encryption

- **Additional Functions**:
  - **Cloud HSM**: Toggle this option if you want your master key to be managed using a Hardware Security Module (HSM)
  - **Malicious Payload Scanning**: This option is enabled by default, scanning data for malicious content
  - **AI Content Detection**: Detects AI-generated content
  - **AI Insights**: Provides transaction insights using the Llama 2 model

## Finalizing Your Project

After filling out all the necessary fields, click the **Create** button to finalize and create your new project.

Once created, you'll be automatically directed to the Project Overview page where you can continue configuring your project by:

1. Creating API keys
2. Setting up data classifications
3. Configuring data proxies
4. Setting up log destinations

## Project Management

After creation, you can manage your project through several tabs:

- **Overview**: General project information and setup progress
- **API Keys**: Manage API keys for authentication
- **Classifications**: Create and manage data classification tags
- **Data Proxies**: View and configure your project's data proxy endpoints
- **Log Destinations**: Configure where project logs are sent
- **Event Log**: View all events related to your project

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your project, you should:

1. [Create an API Key](/project-management/api-keys)
2. [Set Up Data Classifications](/project-management/data-classifications)
3. [Configure Data Proxies](/api/data-proxies/overview)
