# Navigating the Dashboard

After successfully registering and logging into your Qanapi dashboard, you'll be greeted with an intuitive interface designed to help you manage your encryption and data protection needs.

## Dashboard Layout

The Qanapi dashboard is organized into several key areas:

### Left Navigation Sidebar

The sidebar provides access to the main sections of the dashboard:

- **Projects** - View and manage all your encryption projects
- **Team** - Manage team members who have access to your organization
- **Billing** - Manage your subscription, payment methods, and invoices
- **Security Log** - Review security events and activities
- **Settings** - Configure application settings
- **Templates** - Access pre-configured integrations with popular services

### Top Navigation Bar

The top bar contains:

- **Account Menu** - Access your profile settings by clicking your name in the top right
- **Help & Resources** - Documentation and support resources
- **Notifications** - System notifications and alerts

## Projects Page

Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the `/projects` page. This is your dashboard's home page where you can view all projects you've created.

The Projects page displays:

- A list of all your existing projects
- Status indicators for each project
- Quick access to project configurations

If you've just created your account, your Projects page will be empty until you create your first project.
