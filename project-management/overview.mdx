# Project Overview & Management

After creating a new project, you are directed to the Project Overview page. This page provides a summary of your project configuration and a step-by-step guide to help you complete your project setup.

## Project Overview Page

The Project Overview page displays:

- **Project Name and Environment**: The name and environment (Development, Staging, or Production) of your project
- **Project ID**: A unique identifier for your project, used in API calls
- **Creation Date**: When the project was created
- **Datacenter**: Where your project data is stored
- **Encryption Strategy**: The encryption method used for this project
- **Additional Features**: Any additional security features enabled for this project

## Project Configuration Steps

The overview page presents a guided setup process with the following steps:

1. **Create Project** âœ“
   - You've already configured your new Qanapi project.

2. **Create an API Key**
   - API keys allow you to authenticate and use the Qanapi API.
   - Click on the API Keys tab or the corresponding button to create your first API key.

3. **Create Data Classifications**
   - Choose your data classifications to associate them with your sensitive data.
   - Click on the Classifications tab to set up your classification tags.

4. **Data Proxies**
   - Use the Data Proxy to easily encrypt and forward HTTP requests.
   - The Data Proxies tab shows your project-specific endpoint URLs.

## Project Tabs

Your project has several tabs that allow you to configure different aspects:

### API Keys Tab

The [API Keys](/project-management/api-keys) tab allows you to create and manage API keys for your project.

### Classifications Tab

The [Data Classifications](/project-management/data-classifications) tab lets you create and manage data classification tags.

### Data Proxies Tab

The [Data Proxies](/api-v1/data-proxies/overview) tab provides information about your project's data proxy endpoints, which are used for encrypting and decrypting data.

### Log Destinations Tab

The [Log Destinations](/administration/log-destinations) tab allows you to configure where the logs for your project should be sent, including integration with SIEM tools.

### Event Log Tab

The [Event Log](/administration/event-log) tab displays all events related to your project, providing a complete audit trail.

## Project Settings

While viewing a project, you can access project settings by clicking the settings icon in the top-right corner of the project page. This allows you to:

- Update the project name
- View datacenter and configuration details
- Configure additional security features
- Archive or delete the project

<Warning>
Archiving or deleting a project will impact access to data encrypted with that project's keys. Make sure you have properly decrypted any necessary data before taking these actions.
</Warning>

## Managing Multiple Projects

If you have multiple projects, you can:

1. Return to the Projects page by clicking "Projects" in the left sidebar
2. Switch between projects using the project selector dropdown when already in a project
3. Filter and search for specific projects on the Projects page

## Best Practices

For effective project management in Qanapi:

- Use clear, descriptive project names
- Create separate projects for different environments (Development, Staging, Production)
- Use different data classifications for varying sensitivity levels
- Regularly review API key usage
- Monitor the Event Log for unusual activity

## Next Steps

After understanding your project overview, you should:

1. [Create API Keys](/project-management/api-keys)
2. [Set Up Data Classifications](/project-management/data-classifications)
3. [Configure Data Proxies](/api-v1/data-proxies/overview)
