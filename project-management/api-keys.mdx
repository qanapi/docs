# API Keys

API keys are essential for authenticating your applications with the Qanapi service. They allow you to make secure API calls to encrypt, decrypt, and manage your data.

## Creating an API Key

To create a new API key for your project:

1. Navigate to the project for which you want to create an API key
2. Click on the **API Keys** tab in the project navigation
3. Click on the **Create API Key** button
4. A prompt will appear with a security notice, informing you that:
   - The API key will only be displayed once
   - You must store the key securely
   - The key will be irretrievable after it is shown
5. Click **Create API Key** to generate the new key

<Warning>
**Security Notice**: Your API key will only be displayed once immediately after creation. Make sure to copy it and store it in a secure location, as you won't be able to view it again. If you lose your API key, you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

## Managing API Keys

The API Keys tab displays a list of all API keys created for your project, including:

- **Key ID**: A unique identifier for the API key (not the full key)
- **Creation Date**: When the API key was created
- **Status**: Whether the key is active or has been revoked
- **Last Used**: When the API key was last used

### Revoking API Keys

If you need to disable an API key (for example, if it has been compromised):

1. Locate the key you want to revoke in the API Keys list
2. Click the **Revoke** button next to the key
3. Confirm the revocation when prompted

<Info>
Revoking an API key immediately prevents it from being used for authentication. Any applications using the revoked key will no longer be able to access the Qanapi API.
</Info>

## Using API Keys

API keys are used in various Qanapi API calls and with the Smart Data Proxy:

### API Authentication

When making direct API calls to Qanapi, include your API key in the request header:

```bash
curl --location 'https://your-tenant.qanapi.cloud/api/v1/encrypt' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Authorization: your_api_key' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"data": "Your sensitive data"}'
```

### Data Proxy Authentication

When using the Smart Data Proxy, include your API key in the `X-Qanapi-Authorization` header:

```bash
curl --location 'https://your-tenant.qanapi.cloud/proxy/your-project-id' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Authorization: your_api_key' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Mode: encrypt' \
--header 'X-Qanapi-Fields: title,body' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"title": "Sensitive title", "body": "Sensitive body text"}'
```

## API Key Best Practices

To ensure the security of your API keys and data:

1. **Never hardcode API keys** in your application source code
2. **Don't commit API keys** to version control systems
3. **Use environment variables** or secure key management systems to store API keys
4. **Create separate API keys** for different applications or environments
5. **Rotate API keys** periodically for enhanced security
6. **Monitor API key usage** through the Event Log
7. **Revoke unused or compromised keys** immediately

## API Key Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

- You can create up to 10 active API keys per project (contact support if you need more)
- API keys are specific to a project and cannot be used across different projects
- API key requests are rate-limited for security purposes

## Next Steps

After creating your API keys, you should:

1. [Set Up Data Classifications](/project-management/data-classifications)
2. [Configure Data Proxies](/api/data-proxies/overview)
3. [Encrypt and Decrypt Data](/api/data-proxies/encryption)
