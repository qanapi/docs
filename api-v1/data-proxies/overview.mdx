# Smart Data Proxies

The Qanapi Smart Data Proxy provides a powerful HTTP endpoint that allows you to seamlessly encrypt, classify, and protect data within any HTTP request, ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed to the destination.

## What is a Smart Data Proxy?

A Smart Data Proxy acts as an intermediary between your application and external services, automatically encrypting sensitive data before it leaves your control. This approach:

- **Protects sensitive fields** while allowing non-sensitive data to pass through normally
- **Preserves data structure** in JSON payloads
- **Maintains HTTP methods and headers** from the original request
- **Hides sensitive data** from destination services
- **Simplifies integration** with existing applications and services

## Accessing Your Data Proxy

Each project in Qanapi has its own dedicated Smart Data Proxy endpoint. To find your proxy endpoint:

1. Navigate to your project in the Qanapi dashboard
2. Click on the **Data Proxies** tab
3. The page will display your proxy details, including:
   - The environment (e.g., Development)
   - The specific URL for your data proxy (e.g., `https://your-tenant.qanapi.cloud/proxy/your-project-id`)

## Key Features

The Smart Data Proxy offers several powerful features:

### Selective Field Encryption

Choose which fields in your JSON payload require encryption, allowing you to protect only the sensitive data while leaving non-sensitive data in the clear.

### Data Classification

Associate classification tags with your encrypted data to enable fine-grained access control and regulatory compliance.

### Request Forwarding

Optionally forward the modified request (with encrypted data) to another service, allowing for seamless integration with existing workflows.

### Transparent Decryption

Easily decrypt data that was previously encrypted by Qanapi, with proper authentication and authorization.

## How It Works

The Smart Data Proxy follows this general workflow:

1. **Your application** sends a request to the Qanapi Smart Data Proxy
2. **The proxy** authenticates your request using your API key
3. **Qanapi** encrypts the specified fields in your payload
4. **The proxy** either:
   - Returns the modified payload with encrypted data to your application, or
   - Forwards the modified request to a destination service you specify

## Required Headers

When using the Smart Data Proxy, you must include these headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Qanapi-Authorization` | Your API authorization token |
| `X-Qanapi-Mode` | Specify `encrypt` for encryption and `decrypt` for decryption |
| `X-Qanapi-Fields` | Comma-separated list of fields in the JSON payload to be encrypted or decrypted |
| `Content-Type` | Set to `application/json` for JSON payloads |

## Optional Headers

You can also include these optional headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Qanapi-Destination` | A URL to forward the request to after encryption instead of returning the encrypted data to the client |
| `X-Qanapi-Classification` | The classification level of the data (e.g., `cui`, `health`, `financial`) |

## Use Cases

Smart Data Proxies are ideal for:

- **API Integrations**: Secure data before sending it to third-party APIs
- **Database Operations**: Encrypt sensitive fields before storage
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure sensitive data is properly protected for compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Support zero trust security models by encrypting data at all times
